## Good Practices
Before create a new issue:

### Search
Many beginner questions can be answered with simple searches, so before posting your question make sure you have done the necessary searches and bring to the issue the data you have found and the data you did not find about the subject.

#### Search in the internet
1. If your doubt is about a programming language or a specific tool, search on its respective official documentation.
1. You can also use favorite search engine. Give preference for results from official documentation and specialized forums like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org).
